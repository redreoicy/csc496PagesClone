1 game vs bots, updating settings from very low to very high in game.
All in windowed mode.


Several sessions failed to properly start (2-3 seconds long), and should be ignored
Session 1 14:43:38    Very low
Session 2 14:55:58    Low
Session 3 14:46:28    Medium
Session 4 14:48:19    High
Session 5 14:50:03    Very High
Session 6 14:51:00    Very High, with max resolution

Note: despite having uncapped framerate in the settings, some other factor seemed to be limiting the framerate to 60, at least according to the display on LoL.
Likely related to my monitor, (I use a TV with hdmi cable), or graphics driver
