### My setup: A windows 10 computer, AMD FX(tm)-4300 Quad-Core Processor    3.8GHz
64bit Operating system, x64 based processor
8.00GB RAM
AMD Radeon R7 200 Series GPU

### Game 1 Osu 
Osu is a rhythm game, with relatively low graphics. However, there are storyboards that can be added to the maps that are played, and skins which include many effects.  Because of the precise timing involved in many maps, even 2ms lag can be a significant portion of the timing window for a perfect hit.  
Including the storyboard at 0% dim did seem to lower the framerate significantly, while other things did not.  For example, just including the storyboard but with 100% dim didn't noticeably effect the framerate. Probably the majority of work done by the computer is drawing the display

### Game 2 League of Legends
League of Legends is a classic moba.
One very interesting thing was that the GPU usage was at or near 0% until reaching the very high setting, where the GPU began to be used.
All 4 CPU's were used fairly evenly.
The CPUs' tempurature was the highest during the first run(48C), with lowest settings, so likely loading the game was intensive.
Otherwise, the temperature stayed fairly steady at 41C, lowering once the GPU began to be used.
